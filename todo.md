# ToDo

## Set up search

Use a search button to perform query on API endpoint. \
Alternate use would be using setTimeout on search input but YouTube only allows like 20 searches on API \
(5 units per search, 100 units total) \
use axios to hit endpoint, use the returned promise to populate data in search results
